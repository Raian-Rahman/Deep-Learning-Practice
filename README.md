# Deep Learning Practice
This repository contains my practice code for deep learning. Every notebook will be updated when I finish learning something new. An overall description of this repository is given below.

## Folder Description
There are multiple folders in this repository. What files are being contained in which folder is described below:

### Dataset Practice
As we know, the best way to learn a technique is to apply that technique on a dataset. I have practiced multiple things on multiple dataset and those are added in Dataset Practice Folder. Typical naming convention of files are:
``` 
ModelName_DatasetName.FileForamt
```
Datasets I have practiced:
| Model Name                                            	| Dataset  	| Library 	| Domain          	|
|-------------------------------------------------------	|----------	|---------	|-----------------	|
| Convolutional Neural Network                          	| CIFER 10 	| Pytorch 	| Computer Vision 	|
| Convolutional Neural Network with Residual Connection 	| CIFER 10 	| Pytorch 	| Computer Vision 	|
| Resnet 50 Pretrained Model                            	| CIFER 10 	| Pytorch 	| Computer Vision 	|

### Models
As we know, there are a lot of advanced models used in deep learning. I have tried to implement these models from scratch. There model itself can not visualize a lot of things. But, i did those to understand how the internal codes work. Typical naming convention are:
```
ModelName_Library.FileFormat
```
Models I have implemented are:
| Model Name                              	| Library 	| Visualization 	|
|-----------------------------------------	|---------	|---------------	|
| Transformer (Attention is all you need) 	| Pytorch 	| Not available 	|
